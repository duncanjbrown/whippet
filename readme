Depends on PHP 5.4. Under Ubuntu, do:

  $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php5
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install php5

Under OS X, there are some solutions here:

Or, you can download it from PHP.net:

  http://php.net/downloads.php

To get started, cd to the directory containing the wps file, and run it:

  $ ./wps

You'll probably get an error, but all the errors should tell you what to do.
