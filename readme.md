Whippet
-------

Whippet launches a stand-alone web server for a specific WordPress installation.
It makes WordPress easier to develop with, for example, by adding lots of debug 
information to the terminal without cluttering up or breaking your templates.


Installation
------------

Depends on PHP 5.4. Under Ubuntu, do:

  $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php5
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install php5

Under OS X, there are some solutions here:

For other operating systems, please consult Google, or, you can download from PHP.net:

To get started, cd to the whippet directory, and do:

  $ ./whippet

You'll probably get an error, but all the errors should tell you what to do.
