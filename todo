wps uses 100% cpu. Whaaa

It would be very nice if wps could operate just with a wp-content folder. Assume that wordpress core files are elsewhere and make everything hook up nicely.

It would be lovely if we didn't have to use MySQL, and could use sqlite instead for dev environments.

Have a ~/.wpserver settings file

Show plugins being loaded

Show specified filters being executed

Make the location for temporary files configurable (a define will probably do)

Remove all the echo calls from wps and use WPServer::message instead
