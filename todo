wps uses 100% cpu. Whaaaaaat

It would be lovely if we didn't have to use MySQL, and could use sqlite instead for dev environments.

Have a ~/.wpserver settings file

Show plugins being loaded

Make the location for temporary files configurable (a define will probably do)

Remove all the echo calls from wps and use WPServer::message instead

Refactor wps, moving some stuff into other files where that's sensible (eg options parsing/help/checking), making it OO (and DRYer), and paying particular attention to all the filenames and paths that are floating around

When callbacks are listed, multiple callbacks of the same priority get erroneously reordered. They should stay in the order they were added in.

It would be good to cache the callback file:line grep calls into a temp file as they're quite slow.

We should check that grep is available before attempting to run it
